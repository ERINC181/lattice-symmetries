# Doxyfile 1.8.18

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Lattice Symmetries"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

# PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs/

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 2

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice, VHDL,
# Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional documentation
# sections, marked by \if <section_label> ... \endif and \cond <section_label>
# ... \endcond blocks.

ENABLED_SECTIONS       =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = include/lattice_symmetries/
			 
# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories
# that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the
# \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             =

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be
# generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
#
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that
# also VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.
# The default value is: NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body of functions,
# classes and enums directly into the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SOURCES         = NO

# If the CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING tag is set to YES then doxygen will use the
# clang parser (see: http://clang.llvm.org/) for more accurate parsing at the
# cost of reduced performance. This can be particularly helpful with template
# rich C++ code for which doxygen's built-in parser lacks the necessary type
# information.
# Note: The availability of this option depends on whether or not doxygen was
# generated with the -Duse_libclang=ON option for CMake.
# The default value is: NO.

CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING = YES

# If clang assisted parsing is enabled you can provide the compiler with command
# line options that you would normally use when invoking the compiler. Note that
# the include paths will already be set by doxygen for the files and directories
# specified with INPUT and INCLUDE_PATH.
# This tag requires that the tag CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING is set to YES.

CLANG_OPTIONS          =

# If clang assisted parsing is enabled you can provide the clang parser with the
# path to the compilation database (see:
# http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.html) used when the files
# were built. This is equivalent to specifying the "-p" option to a clang tool,
# such as clang-check. These options will then be passed to the parser.
# Note: The availability of this option depends on whether or not doxygen was
# generated with the -Duse_libclang=ON option for CMake.

CLANG_DATABASE_PATH    =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the XML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_XML           = YES

# The XML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the XML pages will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: xml.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_OUTPUT             = xml

# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES, doxygen will dump the program
# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = YES

# If the XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE tag is set to YES, doxygen will include
# namespace members in file scope as well, matching the HTML output.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: YES.

HAVE_DOT               = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING tag is set to YES, doxygen will evaluate all
# C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include files.
# The default value is: YES.

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES, doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO, only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting
# EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES then
# the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the PREDEFINED and
# EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# If the SEARCH_INCLUDES tag is set to YES, the include files in the
# INCLUDE_PATH will be searched if a #include is found.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# SEARCH_INCLUDES        = YES

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by the
# preprocessor.
# This tag requires that the tag SEARCH_INCLUDES is set to YES.

# INCLUDE_PATH           =

# You can use the INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard
# patterns (like *.h and *.hpp) to filter out the header-files in the
# directories. If left blank, the patterns specified with FILE_PATTERNS will be
# used.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS  =

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

PREDEFINED             =

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then this
# tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded. The
# macro definition that is found in the sources will be used. Use the PREDEFINED
# tag if you want to use a different macro definition that overrules the
# definition found in the source code.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

EXPAND_AS_DEFINED      =

# If the SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS tag is set to YES then doxygen's preprocessor will
# remove all references to function-like macros that are alone on a line, have
# an all uppercase name, and do not end with a semicolon. Such function macros
# are typically used for boiler-plate code, and will confuse the parser if not
# removed.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS   = YES
