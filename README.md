**WARNING** This is work-in-progress

A package to simplify working with symmetry-adapted quantum many-body bases
(think spin systems). It is written with two main applications in mind:

* Exact diagonalization;
* Experiments with neural quantum states and symmetries.

`lattice_symmetries` provides a relatively low-level (and high-performance)
interface to working with symmetries and Hilbert space bases and operators. If
all you want to do it to diagonalize a spin Hamiltonian, have a look at
[`SpinED`](https://github.com/twesterhout/spin-ed) application which uses
`lattice_symmetries` under the hood and provides a high-level and user-friendly
interface to exact diagonalization.


## üôè Help wanted!

There are a few improvements to this package which could benefit a lot of
people, but I don't really have time to do them all myself...

1) Implement distributed matrix-vector products. It would be nice to be able to
run this code on, say, 4 nodes to have a bit more memory.
2) Implement fermion basis which handles symmetries properly. This is a matter
of plugging `-1`s in the right places, but should be done carefully!
3) Consider implementing sublattice-coding techniques. This *could* potentially
speed-up `ls_get_state_info` function. Whether it *will* actually help is not
clear at all since batching of symmetries already does a great job of improving
performance...

If you're interested in working on one of these ideas, please, don't hesitate to
contact me. I'd be happy to discuss it further and guide you through it.

## üñã Citing

If you are using this package in your research, please, consider citing the
following paper (**WIP**):
```
@unpublished{citekey,
  author = "",
  title  = "",
  note   = "",
  month  = "",
  year   = "",
  annote = "".
}
```


## üöÄ Installation

System requirements:

  * Linux or OS X operating system;
  * x86-64 processor with
  [nehalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)) (released
  in 2008) or newer microarchitecture. But no, it's not Intel only. The code
  will work on AMD processors just fine.


### Conda

If you are mainly going to use the Python interface, using
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is the suggested way of installing the
package.

```sh
conda install -c twesterhout lattice-symmetries
```

**Note:** Conda package installs both C and Python interfaces, so even if you do
not need the Python interface, using `conda` is the simplest way to get started.


### Compiling from source

If you are going to contribute to the project or just want to have more control
over the installation, it is possible to compile `lattice_symmetries` from
source. There are almost no external dependencies so the process is quite
simple. You will need the following:

  * C & C++ compiler (with C++17 support);
  * GNU Make or Ninja;
  * CMake (**3.15+**);
  * Git

We also provide a [Conda environment
file](https://github.com/twesterhout/lattice-symmetries/blob/master/conda-devel.yml)
which contains the required dependencies (except Git).

First step is to clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/twesterhout/lattice-symmetries.git
cd lattice-symmetries
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Create a directory where build artifacts will be stored:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run the configure step which will determine the compilers to use, download
dependencies etc.

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

The following CMake parameters affect the build:

  * `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: when `ON` shared version of the library will be built,
  otherwise -- static. Note that static library cannot be loaded from Python. It
  is thus suggested to use the shared version unless you know what you are
  doing.
  * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`: where to install the library.
  * `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: typically `Release` for optimized builds and `Debug` for
  development and testing.
  * `LatticeSymmetries_ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING`: when `ON` unit tests will be
  compiled (default: `ON`).
  * `LatticeSymmetries_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY`: when `ON`, `clang-tidy` will be used
  for static analysis. Note that this slows down the compilation quite a bit.
  * Other standard CMake flags such as `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`, `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`,
  etc.


Build the library:

```sh
cmake --build .
```

And finally install it:

```sh
cmake --build . --target install
```

Now you can install Python wrappers using `pip`. Note that Python code uses
`pkg-config` to determine the location of `liblattice_symmetries.so` (or
`.dylib`). Make sure you either set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` appropriately or install
into a location known to `pkg-config`.


## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Example

[`example/getting_started`](https://github.com/twesterhout/lattice-symmetries/tree/master/example/getting_started)
folder contains `main.py` and `main.c` files which illustrate very basic usage
of the package from both Python and C. The code contains explanatory comments.

To run the example from Python simply type:

```console
$ cd example/getting_started
$ python3 main.py
Symmetry group contains 20 elements
Hilbert space dimension is 13
Ground state energy is -18.0617854180
```

To run the example from C we first need to compile it:

```console
$ # (Optionally) tell pkg-config where lattice_symmetries library was installed.
$ # If you installed the package using Conda, it's already taken care of for you.
$ #
$ # export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
$ cc `pkg-config --cflags lattice_symmetries` -o main main.c `pkg-config --libs lattice_symmetries`
```

Now we can run it as well:

```console
$ # (Optionally) tell ld where lattice_symmetries library was installed:
$ # If you installed the package using Conda, it's already taken care of for you.
$ #
$ # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ ./main
Symmetry group contains 20 elements
Hilbert space dimension is 13
Ground state energy is -18.0617854180
```


## üö¥ Performance

![basis construction](benchmark/01_basis_construction.png)
![operator application](benchmark/02_operator_application.png)


## C API

1) Add the following include your source file

   ~~~~c
   #include <lattice_symmetries/lattice_symmetries.h>
   ~~~~

2. Link against `liblattice_symmetries.so` (or `.dylib` if you're on OS X, or
   `.a` if you're using the static version). `pkg-config` can take care of it
   for you.


### Error handling

`lattice_symmetries` library uses status codes for reporting errors. `ls_error_code` specifies all
possible status codes which can be returned by library functions:

```c
typedef enum ls_error_code {
    LS_SUCCESS = 0,             ///< No error
    LS_OUT_OF_MEMORY,           ///< Memory allocation failed
    LS_INVALID_ARGUMENT,        ///< Argument to a function is invalid
    LS_INVALID_HAMMING_WEIGHT,  ///< Invalid Hamming weight
    LS_INVALID_SPIN_INVERSION,  ///< Invalid value for spin_inversion
    LS_INVALID_NUMBER_SPINS,    ///< Invalid number of spins
    LS_INVALID_PERMUTATION,     ///< Argument is not a valid permutation
    LS_INVALID_SECTOR,          ///< Sector exceeds the periodicity of the operator
    LS_INVALID_STATE,           ///< Invalid basis state
    LS_INVALID_DATATYPE,        ///< Invalid datatype
    LS_PERMUTATION_TOO_LONG,    ///< Such long permutations are not supported
    LS_INCOMPATIBLE_SYMMETRIES, ///< Symmetries are incompatible
    LS_NOT_A_REPRESENTATIVE,    ///< Spin configuration is not a representative
    LS_WRONG_BASIS_TYPE,        ///< Expected a basis of different type
    LS_CACHE_NOT_BUILT,         ///< List of representatives is not yet built
    LS_COULD_NOT_OPEN_FILE,     ///< Failed to open file
    LS_FILE_IO_FAILED,          ///< File input/output failed
    LS_CACHE_IS_CORRUPT,        ///< File does not contain a list of representatives
    LS_OPERATOR_IS_COMPLEX,     ///< Trying to apply complex operator to real vector
    LS_DIMENSION_MISMATCH,      ///< Operator dimension does not match vector length
    LS_SYSTEM_ERROR,            ///< Unknown error
} ls_error_code;
```

Names of the constants should explain errors pretty well, however for
higher-level wrappers it is useful to convert these status codes to
human-readable messages. `ls_error_to_string` function provides such
functionality:

```c
char const* ls_error_to_string(ls_error_code code);
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Even though internally the library is written in C++17, exceptions are disabled
during compilation. I.e. we never throw exceptions, all errors are reported
using status codes. This makes it easy and safe to use the library inside OpenMP
loops.


### Spin configuration

Depending on the context (i.e. whether it is known if the system size is less
than 64) one of the following two types is used to represent spin
configurations:

```c
typedef uint64_t ls_bits64;

typedef struct ls_bits512 {
    ls_bits64 words[8];
} ls_bits512;
```

‚ÄºÔ∏è **Warning:** we do not support systems with more than 512 spins. This is a
design decision to limit the memory footprint of a single spin configuration. If
you really want to use `lattice_symmetries` for larger systems, please, let us
know by opening an issue.

Each spin is represented by a single bit. The order of spins is determined by
the underlying hardware [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).
For example, you can use the following functions to get the value (`+1` or `-1`)
of the `n`th spin:

```c
int get_nth_spin_64(ls_bits64 const bits, unsigned const n)
{
    return 2 * (int)((bits >> n) & 1U) - 1;
}

int get_nth_spin_512(ls_bits512 const* bits, unsigned const n)
{
    return get_nth_spin_64(bits->words[n / 64U], n % 64U);
}
```


### Symmetry

Opaque struct representing a symmetry operator:

```c
typedef struct ls_symmetry ls_symmetry;
```

* * *

Symmetries are constructed and destructed using the following two functions:

```c
ls_error_code ls_create_symmetry(ls_symmetry** ptr, unsigned length, unsigned const permutation[],
                                 unsigned sector);
void ls_destroy_symmetry(ls_symmetry* symmetry);
```

`ls_create_symmetry` accepts a `permutation` of indices `{0, 1, ..., length-1}`
and `sector` specifying the eigenvalue. *Periodicity* of a permutation operator
`T` is the smallest positive integer `N` such that <code>T<sup>N</sup> =
ùüô</code>. It then follows that eigenvalues of `T` are roots of unity: `-2œÄ‚Öàk/N`
for `k ‚àà {0, ..., N-1}`. `sector` argument specifies the value of `k`.

Upon successful completion of `ls_create_symmetry` (indicated by returning
`LS_SUCCESS`), `*ptr` is set to point to the newly allocated `ls_symmetry`
object. All pointers created using `ls_create_symmetry` must be destroyed using
`ls_destroy_symmetry` to avoid memory leaks.


* * *

Various properties can be accessed using getter functions:

```c
unsigned ls_get_periodicity(ls_symmetry const* symmetry);
void ls_get_eigenvalue(ls_symmetry const* symmetry, _Complex double* out);
unsigned ls_get_sector(ls_symmetry const* symmetry);
double ls_get_phase(ls_symmetry const* symmetry);
unsigned ls_symmetry_get_number_spins(ls_symmetry const* symmetry);
```

`ls_get_periodicity` returns the periodicity `N` such that applying the symmetry
`N` times results in identity. `ls_get_eigenvalue` stores the eigenvalue
`-2œÄ‚Öàk/N` in `out`. `k` is the sector which can be obtained with
`ls_get_sector`. `ls_get_phase` returns `k / N`. `ls_symmetry_get_number_spins`
returns the number of spins for which the symmetry was constructed (i.e.  length
of the permutation passed to `ls_create_symmetry`)

* * *

Symmetry operators can also be applied to spin configurations:

```c
void ls_apply_symmetry(ls_symmetry const* symmetry, ls_bits512* bits);
```

`ls_apply_symmetry` will permute `bits` in-place according to the permutation
with which the symmetry was constructed.


### Symmetry group

Opaque struct representing a symmetry group:

```c
typedef struct ls_group ls_group;
```

Groups are meant to be used mostly as intermediate data structured for
constructing the bases. We do not provide many functions for working with them.

* * *

Symmetry groups are constructed and destructed using the following functions:

```c
ls_error_code ls_create_group(ls_group** ptr, unsigned size, ls_symmetry const* generators[]);
void ls_destroy_group(ls_group* group);
```

`ls_create_group` receives an array of `size` symmetry generators and tries to
build a group from them. If symmetries are incommensurable an error will be
returned. Note that `ls_create_group` **does not take ownership** of `generators`.

* * *

Some information about a symmetry group can be obtained using the following
getter functions:

```c
unsigned ls_get_group_size(ls_group const* group);
ls_symmetry const* ls_group_get_symmetries(ls_group const* group);
int ls_group_get_number_spins(ls_group const* group);
```

`ls_get_group_size` returns the number of elements in the group.
`ls_group_get_symmetries` returns a pointer to an array of symmetries. This
array is internal and owned by `ls_group`. Do not try to `free` it, and make
sure **that `ls_group` stays alive as long as you are using this pointer**.
`ls_group_get_number_spins` returns the number of spins in the system. If it
cannot be determined (because the group is empty), `-1` is returned.


### Spin basis

Opaque struct representing a spin basis:

```c
typedef struct ls_spin_basis ls_spin_basis;
```

* * *

Bases are created and destructed using the following functions:

```c
ls_error_code ls_create_spin_basis(ls_spin_basis** ptr, ls_group const* group,
                                   unsigned number_spins, int hamming_weight,
                                   int spin_inversion);
ls_spin_basis* ls_copy_spin_basis(ls_spin_basis const* basis);
void ls_destroy_spin_basis(ls_spin_basis* basis);
```

`ls_create_spin_basis` receives a symmetry group, the number of spins in the
system, and Hamming weight. Symmetry group may be empty (i.e. if
`ls_create_group` was called with no symmetries), but must not be `NULL`. If one
does not wish to restrict the space to a particular Hamming weight, `-1` can be
used for `hamming_weight`. Upon successful completion of the function `*ptr` is
set to point to the newly constructed spin basis. The basis should later on be
destroyed using `ls_destroy_spin_basis`, otherwise a memory leak will occur.

`ls_copy_spin_basis` allows one to create a shallow copy of the basis. A copy
obtained from `ls_copy_spin_basis` must also be destroyed using
`ls_destroy_spin_basis`. Internally, reference counting is used, so copying a
basis even for a large system is a cheap operation.

The are a few functions to query basis properties:
```c
unsigned ls_get_number_spins(ls_spin_basis const* basis);
unsigned ls_get_number_bits(ls_spin_basis const* basis);
int ls_get_hamming_weight(ls_spin_basis const* basis);
bool ls_has_symmetries(ls_spin_basis const* basis);
```
`ls_get_number_spins` returns the number of spins in the system.
`ls_get_number_bits` returns the number of bits used to represent spin
configurations. `ls_get_hamming_weight` returns the Hamming weight, `-1` is
returned if Hilbert space is not restricted to a particular Hamming weight.
`ls_has_symmetries` returns whether lattice symmetries were used in the
construction of the basis.

```c
void ls_get_state_info(ls_spin_basis* basis, uint64_t const bits[8], uint64_t representative[8],
                       void* character, double* norm);
```
**TODO:** description.

There are also a few functions which are available only for small systems after
a list of representatives has been built:
```c
ls_error_code ls_build(ls_spin_basis* basis);
ls_error_code ls_get_number_states(ls_spin_basis const* basis, uint64_t* out);
ls_error_code ls_get_index(ls_spin_basis const* basis, uint64_t const bits[1], uint64_t* index);
```
`ls_build` function builds the internal cache. Is is a quite expensive operation.

```c
ls_error_code ls_get_states(ls_states** ptr, ls_spin_basis const* basis);
void          ls_destroy_states(ls_states* states);
uint64_t const* ls_states_get_data(ls_states const* states);
uint64_t ls_states_get_size(ls_states const* states);
```

### Python interface





## Other software

[QuSpin](...) is a very general Python package for working with many-body
systems using exact-diagonalization-like methods. I am a big fan! However, it is
very tightly coupled to Python and could not be easily incorporated into
variational Monte Carlo code I was working on. This was my main reason for
partially reimplementing QuSpin's functionality. Hence, this package provides a
portable C interface with minimal dependencies.

It turns out, however, that this package is also considerably faster than QuSpin
and can thus handle larger systems. For systems larger than 32 spins, storing
the Hamiltonian as a matrix (even sparse) is impractical. However, computing
matrix elements on the fly requires that symmetry applications are very
efficient, and the implementation in QuSpin is not quite there yet.


## Reading the source code

The code can be roughly divided into a few layers. At the very bottom we have
error handling (`error_handling.*` files) and utilities (`bits512.hpp`,
`intrusive_ptr.hpp` files). Next, we have the permutation-to-Benes-network
compiler (`permutation.*` files). Intermediate representation of these networks
are then converted into more compact form optimized for forward propagation
(`network.*` files define the representation and `kernel.*` files implement the
 forward propagation). Using Benes networks we build symmetries (`symmetry.*`).
They keep track of the characters of the symmetry group, allow to find
representative vectors (`state_info.*` files), etc. Given a bunch of symmetry
operators, we construct the symmetry group (`group.*` files). Finally, this
symmetry group is used to construct a Hilbert space basis (`basis.*` files). For
small systems, one can explicitly construct a list of all representative vectors
of the basis. We call it "cache" (`cache.*` files). It allows one to determine
the Hilbert space dimension, assigns indices to representative vectors etc.

Having a Hilbert space basis is typically not enough. We need to define a
Hamiltonian. All operators in `lattice_symmetries` are assumed to be Hermitian
and are defined as sums of "interaction" terms (`operator.*` files). These are
just small operators defined on 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-spin subsystems. Operators can
then be applied to explicit vectors (e.g. for exact diagonalization) or in a CPS
(continuation-passing-style) for more general applications (e.g. neural quantum
states).
